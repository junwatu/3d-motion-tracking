# Building a 3D Motion Tracker: Integrating IMU, Arduino, Babylon.js, and GridDB

![blog cover](images/cover.png)

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will build a 3D motion tracker that can visualize the motion of an object in real-time. The motion data is collected from an IMU sensor and Arduino Uno, processed in Node.js, and visualized in Babylon.js. The GridDB is used for data store for future analysis.

## Hardware Requirements

### IMU sensor

IMU sensor is a device that measures the motion, orientation, and environmental conditions of an object. It consists of an accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer. The accelerometer measures the acceleration of the object, the gyroscope measures the angular velocity, and the magnetometer measures the magnetic field. The IMU sensor used in this project is the [MPU-9250](https://invensense.tdk.com/download-pdf/mpu-9250-datasheet/).

### Arduino board

In this project, we use [Arduino Uno](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/uno-rev3/) to read the sensor data from the IMU sensor. The Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. It has 14 digital input/output pins, 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz quartz crystal, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button.

The Arduino Uno is programmed using the [Arduino Software (IDE)](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v2/tutorials/getting-started-ide-v2/). Please follow the [official guide](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v2/tutorials/getting-started/ide-v2-downloading-and-installing/) to install the Arduino IDE on your computer.
