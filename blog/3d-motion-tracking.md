# Building a 3D Motion Tracker: Integrating IMU, Arduino, Babylon.js, and GridDB

![blog cover](images/cover.png)

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will build a 3D motion tracker that can visualize the motion of an object in real-time. The motion data is collected from an IMU sensor and Arduino Uno, processed in Node.js, and visualized in Babylon.js. The GridDB is used for data store for future analysis.

## Hardware Requirements

### IMU sensor

An IMU sensor, or Inertial Measurement Unit sensor is a device that measures the motion, orientation, and environmental conditions of an object. It consists of an **accelerometer**, **gyroscope**, and **magnetometer**. The accelerometer measures the acceleration of the object, the gyroscope measures the angular velocity, and the magnetometer measures the magnetic field. The IMU sensor used in this project is the [MPU-9250](https://invensense.tdk.com/download-pdf/mpu-9250-datasheet/). We will use GY-91 module that contains the MPU-9250 sensor.

### Arduino board

In this project, we use [Arduino Uno](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/uno-rev3/) to read the sensor data from the IMU sensor. The Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. It has 14 digital input/output pins, 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz quartz crystal, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button.

## Software Requirements

These are the main software components used in this project:

### Arduino IDE

The Arduino Uno is programmed using the [Arduino Software (IDE)](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v2/tutorials/getting-started-ide-v2/). Please follow the [official guide](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v2/tutorials/getting-started/ide-v2-downloading-and-installing/) to install the Arduino IDE on your computer.

### Node.js

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. It is used to build scalable network applications. Please follow the [official guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to install Node.js on your computer.

Node.js is used as a server to process the motion data from the IMU sensor, store to database and send it to the web browser.

### GridDB

GridDB is an open-source, in-memory NoSQL database for IoT and big data applications. It is optimized for time-series data and geospatial data. Please follow the [official guide](https://griddb.org/docs/install-and-setup/) to install GridDB on your computer.

GridDB is used to store the motion data from the IMU sensor for future analysis.

## Initial Setup Instructions

### Setting up the hardware

The IMU sensor is connected to the Arduino Uno using the I2C interface. The device interconnection is shown in the following diagram:

The connections are as follows:

| Arduino Uno Pin | GY-91 IMU Sensor Pin |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| 3.3V            | VCC               |
| GND             | GND               |
| A4 (SDA)        | SDA               |
| A5 (SCL)        | SCL               |

To program the Arduino Uno, it is need to be connected to the computer using the USB cable.
